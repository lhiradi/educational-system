## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.10+
* A virtual environment tool like `venv` (recommended).

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/lhiradi/educational-system.git](https://github.com/lhiradi/educational-system.git)
    cd educational-system
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate

    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the project's root directory. Copy and paste the following content into it, replacing the placeholder values with your actual configuration.

    ```env
    # Flask App Secret Key (change this to a random string)
    SECRET_KEY='a_very_secret_and_secure_key'

    # Database Configuration (example uses SQLite)
    SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI='sqlite:///site.db'
    SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS=False

    # Default Admin User (created automatically on first run)
    ADMIN_ID='admin1'
    ADMIN_PASSWORD='securepassword123'
    ADMIN_EMAIL='admin@example.com'
    ADMIN_FIRST_NAME='Admin'
    ADMIN_LAST_NAME='User'
    ADMIN_NATIONAL_ID='1234567890'
    ADMIN_DOB='2000-01-01'

    # Email Server for OTP (example for Gmail)
    MAIL_SERVER='smtp.gmail.com'
    MAIL_PORT=587
    MAIL_USE_TLS=True
    MAIL_USERNAME='your-email@gmail.com'
    MAIL_PASSWORD='your-gmail-app-password'
    MAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER='"Educational System" <your-email@gmail.com>'
    ```
    > **Note:** For Gmail, you will need to generate an **App Password** from your Google Account security settings to use for `MAIL_PASSWORD`.

5.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    The application will start on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. The database file (`site.db`) and the default admin user will be created automatically the first time you run the app.
